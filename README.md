# Advanced CSS: Portfolio Challenege

## Description

Welcome to my Portfolio challenge. This is my first attempt at coding from scratch. I learned alot through the process and plan on implementing some things differently on my next attempt. The nav buttons in the top right(besides resume are functional. The project button takes you to the section to look at my github refactor code, which is uploaded here. The contact me button is functional and take you to a working email me button that actively opens your native email window. Feedback is appreciated so that i can improve in the future. I had fun making this and i hope you enjoy checking out my early work.
